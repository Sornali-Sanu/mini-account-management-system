# 🧾 Mini Account Management System

This is a simple **Account Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages** with **Identity** for user authentication. The system is designed to manage user registration, login, and secure access control. 

🔐 Authentication Workflow
ASP.NET Core Identity is set up under the /Areas/Identity/ folder.

Default Identity UI is scaffolded and customized.

The _LoginPartial.cshtml is included in the main layout to display login/register links or user info after login.

👥 Login Flow
Click Register from the navigation bar.

Register a new account with email and password.

Login using the credentials.

After login, your username and Logout option will appear in the header.

You can add role-based navigation and access restrictions in the next phases.
